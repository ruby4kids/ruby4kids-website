DateSelectorHelper
==================

You need to install this selector to place the required javascripts, stylesheets, and images to the right folder of your public folder.

./script/plugin install ./vendor/plugins/date_selector_helper

The installation will also add the following lines to the header of your application.rhtml layout file. 

<%= stylesheet_link_tag("calendar-blue") %>
<%= javascript_include_tag("calendar") %>
<%= javascript_include_tag("lang/calendar-en") %>
<%= javascript_include_tag("calendar-setup") %>

If you want to use this date_selector_helper in your self-defined layout other than application.rhtml, you need to manually add these four lines to your header.
